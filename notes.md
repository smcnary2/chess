git commit: verb(object)description

**Polymorphism**: many form  
its an abstraction technique that allows your programing to be flexible
- interfaces are a way things can be abstracted

**Interfaces**: basically create an outline for what you program
- implements: uses this part of the interface?

**Inherits**: copies everything from the parent/superclass to the subclass
- I think the work is extend to actually use it and then .super to reference the method 
- you can only have one parent in Java
- Everything in Java inherits from Object

**Abstract**:hybrid of an interface and inheritance
- So someone has to extend the class you abstract and they write the class

**Copying Objects**: 
- copy.variable then it will add all the attributes from var to another var
- its just overloading a constructor  
shallow copy: just causes the two var to share the same pointers. Chnage one you chnage them both  
deep copy: it copies everything from the original var or object
